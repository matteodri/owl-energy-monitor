## Purpose
Java application that listens to multicast UDP messages generated by the Owl Intuition home energy monitor, saves them in InfluxDB and makes the data available through Grafana.
Application requires to be running on the same network the Owl Intuition is connected to.
Integration has been tested using a [Owl Intuition-PV](http://www.theowl.com/index.php/energy-monitors/solar-pv-monitoring/intuition-pv/).

## OWL Intuition
[OWL Intuition](http://www.theowl.com/index.php/owl-intuition/) is an electricity monitoring system that can track electricity consumption and, in the PV version, record electricity produced from photovoltaic panels. Their software provides a way to monitor system electricity flows, keeping historical data that can be accessed, with some limitations, from their website. Measures are constantly published over multicast messages on the local network.

## Owl multicast messages
The	Network	OWL	sends	UDP	packets	tothe	following	multicast	group:

    Address: 224.192.32.19
    Port: 22600

Information on message format can be found here: [Multicast and UDP API information](https://theowl.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/201284603-Multicast-UDP-API-Information).
